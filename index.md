##About bashCoin.

**bashCoin** is cryto cyrrency which is built on top of the blochchain technology. Of course, it is not a hard to change project from crytocurreny to other concept. 


### Architecture of software

The Core [**bashCoin.sh**](https://github.com/aze2201/bashCoin/blob/main/bin/bashCoin.sh)  software is developed on bash 5.1. 

It can do:
- Mining next block.
- Validating pending transaction and adding to next block.
- Printing tranaction data to client for sign it.
- Adding client signed transaction to pending transaction.

Remain:
- new external Block validation.
- Choose longest Chain (to resolve conflict)


Newtorking

The bashCoin uses [Websocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) protocol to interact with other nodes and external 3rt party apps. The websocket protocol help to achieve bidirectional communication. As, it is standarized by **W3C** it is easy to find library for connection in all programming language.

Topology:
![internal client (bashCoin.sh) - server - external client](https://github.com/aze2201/bashCoin/blob/main/data/TopologyBashCoin_v1.png)


It can do:
- Find internal socket id which is executing bashCoin.sh
- Return result to who requested. 

Remain:
- Local broadcasting for notification (127.0.0.1)
